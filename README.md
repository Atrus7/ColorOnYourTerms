ColorOnYourTerms
================

Dynamic color change for iTerm2. NO RESTARTING. INSTANT GRATIFICATION. Once you load a color-preset into iTerm2, it'll be available to automatically be called. (NOTE: YOU have to do it. The default one's aren't stored in the same place)

Currently this program requires a Nightly build of iTerm2, since the stable version hasn't been updated to the new applescript.

TO RUN:
1. Get Nightly Build
2. Change the two global variables according to your system.
3. Run it with python instant_color.py "color_preset_name"

Ideas:
a) Get automator to do it depending on time of day 
OR
b) Get Vim to do it
